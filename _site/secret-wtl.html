	Honestly, this doesn't have a point. I might put small text pieces here when I feel like it.
	There's no point to reading any of it, honestly.</p>

	<h4 class=title> Post 2: breathing </h4>
	<p class=body>
		i find it hard to breath sometimes. More like all the time. <br>
		it kind of hurts. like i'm constantly drowning but also about to puke. <br>
		sometimes i fantasize about just taking a knife and splitting my throat open. <br>
		maybe then I'll be able to breathe. maybe then this overwhelming pressure will be gone, maybe then i will feel free. maybe then i'll be motivated. maybe then i'll have a dream again. maybe then i'll be happy.
